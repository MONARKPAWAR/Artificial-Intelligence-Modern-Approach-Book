## Artificial Intelligence Modern Approach Book - Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig



There are many textbooks that offer an introduction to artificial intelligence (AI). This text has five principal features that together distinguish it from other texts.

* Unified presentation of the field.
* Intelligent agent design.
* Comprehensive and up-to-date coverage.
* Equal emphasis on theory and practice.
* Understanding through implementation.

This book is primarily intended for use in an undergraduate course or course sequence.

It can also be used in a graduate-level course (perhaps with the addition of some of the primary sources suggested in the bibliographical notes).

Because of its comprehensive coverage and the large number of detailed algorithms, it is useful as a primary reference volume for AI graduate students and professionals wishing to branch out beyond their own subfield.

They also hope that AI researchers could benefit from thinking about the unifying approach we advocate.

The only prerequisite is familiarity with basic concepts of computer science __(algorithms, data structures, complexity)__ at a sophomore level.

Freshman calculus is useful for understanding neural networks and adaptive probabilistic networks in detail.

Some experience with non-numeric programming is desirable, but can be picked up in a few weeks study.

They provide implementations of all algorithms in Common Lisp (see Appendix B), but other languages such as Scheme, Prolog, Smalltalk, C++, or ML could be used instead.
